This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Terminal

Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application.

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential commands to know.**

List the correct Terminal commands to do the actions listed below. Replace **CMD** with the correct command sequence. You can keep or enhance the brief description.

**The last bullet provides an example**.

- [ Clear ]: Clear the Screen
- [ PWD ]: Print the "Working Directory"
- [ ls ]: List files and folders
- [ CMD ]: List files and folders, including invisible files
- [ ls -a ]: List all files and folders, in human readable form
- [ cd ]: Change directory
- [ cd / ]: Change directory, go to root directory
- [ cd ~ ]: Change directory and go to user home directory
- [ cd .. ]: Change directory, go up one folder level
- [ cd ../.. ]: Change directory, go up two folder levels
- [ cd ~/desktop ]: Change directory to my desktop!

**2. Using Terminal...**

**Folder Drop:** Try typing "cd" followed by a space, and then drag a folder into terminal and press return. Test this out and describe your results below.

[ The terminal shows me from point A to B to get to that folder. User/wurdeman/Desktop/Personal ]

## Topic: Version Control & Git

Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Update the information below where indicated.

**1. There are three types of version control.**

[ Local: This version involves coping a file from a directory to make edits on a singular field i.e. your desktop. This version would only update on that local field and not in the directory as it will not be linked.

Centrailized: This method to me is like a train on one track with multiple stations within the track. A piece of code can be checked out amongst a team on that one server (Track) to allow for collaboration to achieve a singular goal. No outside sources can link to this directoy unless added onto the track.

Distributed: This method is like a fail safe. Developers can take repositories from a main server and place it on their own Centrailized track. These repositories are connected to the main server but are able to be collaborted and worked on a shared database if that server were to crash.

]

**2. Using Terminal, there are also essential Git commands to know.**

List the correct Git commands to do the actions listed below in Terminal. Replace CMD with the correct command and keep or enhance the brief description.

- [ Git clone ]: Clone a repository
- [ git config --global username ]: Set-up a global user name
- [ git config --global email ]: Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account email)
- [ git status ]: Shows the current state of your directory and staging area
- [ git add . ]: Add modified files to the next commit
- [ git commit -m "Your message" ]: Make a commit with a new message
- [ git log ]: Show my commit history
- [ git helpx ]: Show Git's help screen

**3. Connecting to GitHub using Terminal.**
HTTPS is the the correct way to connect to GitHub in this course. Describe how you connect to GitHub from Terminal using this protocol. What steps do you take?

[ Describe the steps to connect Terminal to a GitHub repo here ]

**4. Using .gitignore and Why it's Important**  
Most repositories contain a .gitignore file.

- What is the purpose of this file?
  <br>
  [The purpose of this is to not track the files not needing tracked.]

- What is the "**.DS_Store**" file and why would you want to ignore it?
  <br>
  [A DS Store file is an invisible file on the macOS operating system that gets automatically created anytime you look into a folder with Finder. You should ignore this because it is irrelevant to a code or project.]

- What other file or folder would you want to add to a .gitignore file and why?
  <br>
  [One file to put on gitignore is .log. The reason for this is that it could contain file paths and credentials that could be taken by hackers.]

Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic and to use material provided to you in this class. You are encouraged to link to your own independent research as well.

[ During this week of researching Git Hub and terminal commands, the useful information was the ones with step by steps and illustrations. Reading it is one thing, but seeing it helps me visually see the process being done. ]
