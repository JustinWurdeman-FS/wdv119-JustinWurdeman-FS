## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week I began my html structure. I had to do plenty of reviewing of prior class materials. At the same time I did alot of research on Git to get more familiar as this was completely new to me. I feel like I have captured what I needed to. I do feel like I may have been to redundant with my code. Making it more complicated than need be.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I did have quite a bit of challenges trying to visually see what the Web template's "Skeleton" was showing. Its like unfolder a 3d oragamy and laying it out flat. Another challenge was remembering content and taking the time to go back and review.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I feel like I have come out of my comfort zone and explored some different coding elements like the container "Article" and "Oneclick" for the button. I have also worked through my hard week of school, work, and family. I had alot of "I want to quit" moments but I pushed through it. I event went out of my way to order more books for Full stack development.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My priorty next week is to review my CSS class just to get a warm and fuzzy again with using box method and adding assets to refer back to for the color schemes. I feel like this week may be smoother since the set up is over and time management should be that much easier to accomplish my task.

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - This week began slow but well. Overall this week as to style the website closest you could to the orginal photo. I went in this week optimistic and determined. It was challenging but after alot of trial and error, I did the best I could.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I had a hard time staying organzied. I had alot of containers that were typed wrong or didnt need to be there. In the end I took a step back and went through each section, organized it and worked my best to style them.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I didnt quit. Life has been hectic with my family and moving. I had a moment of lowness this week and was half tempted to call it. But this was it. I was going to finish. I was going to do research and learn. I did it. I freaking did it. Its not perfect but Ill take it!
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My priorty next week is to review my JavaScript class just to get a warm and fuzzy again with again. I AM GOING TO ORGANIZE MYSELF. That was my hardest part.

### Week 3

🌵 Challenges - This weeks biggest challenge was trying to configure GitHub. I remote linked it to VSCode but I dont know enough about it that it became a mess. Due to this I deleted all from my respository just to upload it again and start over on those fronts.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I feel like I did a great job getting my HTML set up for success. I like my new page and feel that it will flow with the main hub.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My priorty is take make my CSS perfect in my standards. I have used more containers to help me organize and configure my HTML. It should be good.

### Week 4

🌵 Challenges - This weeks biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to incorporate objects to my page. I understood the concept but thought it would be tricky. I also am still trying to figure out github. I got it slightly fixed but still having hiccups.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I put my head down on monday and built my entire CSS page, connected them and tested them. Im very proud of myself that I bought 3 books beginning of the month and have learned so much. Not quitting week 2 was good for me to as I just felt overwhelmed. I hope it was enough!
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My priorty is learn CSS better and then onto JavaScript better. I am almost there with CSS being second nature. I want to figure out what career path to move forward with. There are so many and I want be an artist but with my websites.
